## Bugs

- markdown isn't working
- Look into npm update - why isn't npm update working ???

## Features

- Add .completed() support so we can chain dependent page generation (for index creation, etc.)
- Create a nav array
- Add isActive support
- Add file or folder option, e.g. /about/index.html or about.html
- Cache http models to speed up build

## Questions

- Should models be auto bound to if missing on .page()?
